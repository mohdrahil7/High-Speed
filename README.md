HighSpeed TCP
What is High Speed TCP
1. Just like Standard TCP when cwnd is low
2. More aggressive than Standard TCP when cwnd is high.
3. important question is when is cwnd is low and at what point it
is going to differ with standard TCP.
4. if the size of cwnd is 38 segments then it is considered as low
cwnd and standard TCP is followed.
5. but if size of cwnd is more than 38 segments then HSTCP is
followed.
